# PROJECT CONTEXT
This project was originally assigned to a group of three. However, I completed the entire project on my own, as my two teammates did not contribute to any part of the work. Despite multiple attempts to collaborate, I was ultimately left to handle everything alone.

Professor Campbell and our TA, Issa, were informed of the situation. As a result, the reduced functionality and limited scope were acknowledged and approved by them. The current implementation reflects the maximum progress I could make individually within the project timeline.

If you have any questions about the development process, Iâ€™d be happy to discuss them.
